# Intro to Testing Workshop

## Setup instructions

You'll need a working Python 3 installation. Your OS probably already has one. On macOS you can check by running `which python3`.

You'll also need to install `pytest`, the testing library we'll be using. You can do this with `pip3 install -U pytest`.

## Contents

This repository contains four directories, each with a code kata which should be completed following the rules of test-driven development. In order from simplest to most complex these are:

- `hello-world` - the classic hello world program.
- `fizzbuzz` - everyone's favourite classic interview problem.
- `shopping-cart` - a more complex program involving the interaction of multiple domain entities.
- `game-of-life` - the official #1 most popular cellular automaton.
