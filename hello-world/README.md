# Hello, World!

## Requirements

- Write a function `hello` which takes 0 or 1 arguments.
- If no argument is provided, return `"Hello, World!"`
- If a name is passed in, say hello to that person. E.g. `hello("Matthew")` should return `"Hello, Matthew!"`.

## Notes

- `hello` should be implemented in `hello.py`. Tests should be written in `test_hello.py`.
- There may be sensible test cases which are not directly mentioned in the requirements.
- You can run the tests by running `pytest` from this directory.
